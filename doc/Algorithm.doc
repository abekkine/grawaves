Gravitational Wave Simulation Algorithms:

Body Algorithm

    for each [body] in [universe]
    begin
        update [body] velocity vector by [acceleration].
        update [body] positions by [velocity].
    end

Wave Algorithm

    for each [wave] in [universe]
    begin
        update [wave] [age] value.
        update [wave] [radius] according to constant [speed] value.
    end

Universe Algorithm

    while not done
    begin
        update [bodies] in [universe] for current [sim_time].
        update [waves] in [universe] for current [sim_time].

        for each [wave] in [universe]
            discard [wave] if [age] exceeds [lifetime].
        begin
            
        end

        for each [body] in [universe]
        begin
            initiate a new [wave] of [age] zero from current [body] [position].
            extract the list of waves containing the [body] that is not induced by [body] itself.
            eliminate all waves from the same [source] except for the youngest ones.
            calculate acceleration vector to [body] using remaining wave list.
            set [body] acceleration vector.
        end

        increment [sim_time].
    end
