0001 | CLOSED | Algorithm will be documented.
0002 | CLOSED | Revision number will be embedded into application.
0003 | CLOSED | version file and python bytecode will be added to ignore list.
0004 | CLOSED | Version information will be displayed when application is run.
0005 | CLOSED | All methods will be pre-implemented with 'TODO' comment tag, which will be replaced with 'DONE' after completion.
